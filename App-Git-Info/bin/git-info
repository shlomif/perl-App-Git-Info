I added a "git i" alias for "git info info".

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-GitUtils/script/gu> has an "info"
subcommand, but no sample info is given there and I was unable to install
it from CPAN due to failing tests in one of the dependencies.

Here is a nice 1990s Reggae hit song with a related name:
L<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informer_(song)> , and a youtube search for
it: L<https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=informer+snow> .
